# Plot & Pot


## Objective

**Plot & Pot** is a Java-based web application designed to help users discover suitable plants for their garden based on location-specific climate data. The primary objective of the application is to:

* Fetch location and weather data using a zip code or city input.
* Determine frost risk and temperature conditions for the user’s location.
* Retrieve plant suggestions from an external plant API tailored to the climate.
* Display plant information dynamically as interactive flashcards.
* Demonstrate integration between frontend UI and backend services, real-time data fetching, and clean UI presentation.

This project is intended as a practical exercise in building full-stack applications with real-world API interactions.
